# Whiptail examples

This tool is good for fancy dialog boxes in bash.  It seems pretty simple but
really can dress up your bash code esp. when you want to make it aesthetically
pleasing, inviting, and less scary for people like in an Operations team.

Installation on debian style Linux:

```
sudo apt install whiptail
```

Installation on centos:

```
sudo dnf install newt
```

Examples:

* [yes/no dialogbox](yes-no.sh)
* [press enter to continue dialogbox](continue.sh)
* [radio box](radio.sh)
* [get input](get_input.sh)
